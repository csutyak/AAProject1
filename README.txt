How to run our AAProject1: Flow Network
    There are three programs, and thus three ways to run our program.

    1. Command to run Breadth-First-Search implementation:
        ./main -b <graphFile.txt> s t
        * make sure to input a real graph file that is inside the graph folder
        * variable 's' represents the source, or the starting node of the BFS
        * variable 't' represents the target, or the ending node of the BFS
        * no other input is needed

    2. Command to run Ford-Fulkerson implementation:
        ./main -f <graphFile.txt>
        * make sure to input a real graph file that is inside the graph folder
            * no other input is needed

    3. Command to run circulation problem implementation:
        ./main -c <graphFile.txt>
            * make sure to input a real circulation file that is inside the graph folder
            * no other input is needed

    4. Command to run capacity scaling problem implementation:
        ./main -CF <graphfile.txt>
            * make sure to input a real capacity scaling file that is inside the graph folder
            * no other input is needed

    Special note:
    ***All input graphs must go into graph folder!!!!!!!! :) ***
